  SpaceX is a company on the move. To Mars, someday. But for now, 22,000 miles
  above the Earth's surface. And then back again. That's right, it's time for
  another round of rocket vs. barge! This time, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is
  chauffering a pair of telecom satellites into geostationary transfer orbit.
